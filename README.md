Easy way to monitor your ping in a compact window

### Installation / How to use
If you just want to use the program and don't want anything to do with the code:
- Download and run the ExPing.exe
- It will ask if you want to log your ping, choose either
- It will ask you for the IP address or website address you want to ping, enter anything you'd want and hit ok
